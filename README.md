# Sample Hardhat Project

## FundMe - First Smart Contract :D

The first smart contract with the aim of learning how to create Smart Contracts and how Web3 works
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

What has been done so far:
- Solidity basic,
- Blockchain basics,
- Web3 basics,
- Hardhat (configuration, testing, deploying),
- Gas optimization
- Mocking
- Linting
- And much more

## Features

A simple Smart Contract whose purpose is primarily to learn how Blockchain and Smart Contracts work. The smart contract itself enables the creation of an instance to which users can send cryptocurrency (It is the Ethereum network, and therefore Ether). The instance creator has the ability to withdraw funds. So much for now :D
